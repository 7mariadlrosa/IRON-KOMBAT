# IRON-KOMBAT ðŸ•¹ðŸ’™

## ABOUT 
This idea comes from the references we had from the 90's games, the pixel art aesthetics and above all from this challenging experience that is IronHack. 

Using the AI we get the opponent to move and attack randomly and by using the arrow keys and the letter "A" we make our character defend himself and manage to dodge their attacks. In addition to all this we have power ups, which raise the character's life in real time.

Both the graphics of the characters and the life bars have been illustrated by me in pixel art using Adobe Illustrator. 

**I hope you like it and DON'T GODDAMN IT!!!**
